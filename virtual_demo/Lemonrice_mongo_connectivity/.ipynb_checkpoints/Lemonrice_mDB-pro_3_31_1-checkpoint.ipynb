    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><strong>TODAY:</strong> While bank marketing campaigns have largely remained traditional, standard bank advertising is boring for both marketers and their consumers. Thinking outside the box and implementing creative marketing ideas for banks will help you to develop creative campaigns, benefiting your bank, consumer engagement, and likely the success of the actual bank marketing campaigns as well.\n",

    "Most consumers see banking as a mundane necessity, something theyâ€™d rather avoid if they could. Taking a creative approach to bank marketing campaigns might change that, especially if you integrate creative marketing ideas for banks like gamification, automation, chatbots, and rewards so that consumers are motivated to use your services.</div>"
